Once on it, riders get catapulted up to 60 meters in the air, hitting speeds of up to 200 kilometers per hour and experiencing G Forces similar to those experienced by astronauts in a rocket launch. Feel your feet tangle mid-air for a few moments and enjoy the panoramic views of the Singapore city's skyline before you're lowered to the ground.\nIf you prefer free-falling, try the  instead. The 5-seater capsule is pulled to a near 90-degree angle, 50 meters off the ground, with its riders facing downwards before it is released like a gigantic swing.
